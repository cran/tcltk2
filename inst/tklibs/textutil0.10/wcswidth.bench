# Tcl Benchmark File

# This file contains a number of benchmarks for the 'wcswidth' package.
# This allow developers to monitor/gauge/track package performance.

# We need at least version 8.5 for the package and thus the benchmarks.

## Benchmarks. Fixed, semi-random selection of codepoints across the range.

## A better way may be to scan the entire range of codepoints and then chart the performance.

## With the small set used here it looks as if there is some dependency on the codepoint, with
## higher points taking longer.
#
## I had actually expected that the very low codepoints would do worse as they have to go through
## the entire linear chain of if-commands until the `return 1`, i.e. the main fallback, is reached.

foreach codepoint {
    0 64 127 128 1000 10000 20000 100000 200000 262141 1114111
