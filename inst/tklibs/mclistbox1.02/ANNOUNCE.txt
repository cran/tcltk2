WHO:   Bryan Oakley <oakley@channelpoint.com>
WHAT:  mclistbox v1.02, a pure tcl multicolumn listbox widget
WHERE: http://purl.oclc.org/net/oakley/tcl/mclistbox/index.html

REQUIREMENTS: tcl/tk 8.0 or greater (8.0.3 recommended)
SUPPORTS:     all platforms supported by tcl 8.x


WHAT'S NEW SINCE 1.0:

* fixed bugs in how yview was computed. yview should now return
  the proper value even when the window is resized, and scrolling
  the listbox after resizing should properly scroll all the way
  up and down.

* fixed some bugs when a column id has spaces in it

* fixed a bug in the label bind command, where curly braces were
  improperly being added around the %W substitution.

* added additional tests to the test suite, and improved the format
  of tests to be a bit more readable

* added the file "defs" to the distribution, so that the test
  script (mclistbox.test) would work. This is a modified version
  of the "defs" file that comes with the tcl source. The modifications
  allow for a more human-friendly format of the test data

* fixed a bug where the fill column wasn't filling properly

* fixed a bug when trying to canonize a column name.


BASIC FEATURES:

* multiple columns, each which may have its own foreground and 
  background colors (and fonts, with a caveat), and which may
  be visible or invisible.

* column headers, which may be turned on or off. Headers may
  have fonts, colors and borders distinct from the columns

* scrollable -- the width of all of the columns may exceed the
  size of the container; the view can be adjusted using normal
  methods (ie: by attaching scrollbars)

* a -selectcommand option, which will run a command whenever
  the selection changes. Doing something when the selection
  changes seems to be something a lot of beginners stumble
  over; this feature is an attempt to alleviate that to some
  degree.

* written in pure tcl. Nothing more to download or install. 

* completely, totally, free. I retain copyright but you are 
  free to use the code however you see fit. Don't be mean.

* fully cross-platform. Works on Macintosh, Unix, and other
  more inferior operating systems :-)

* an API that is a superset of the standard listbox (for a low,
  low double-yer-money-back-guarantee learning curve)



KNOWN BUGS:

* I'm not sure if the option database code is working right; I'm
  not really up to speed on how best to use it.

* if you use different fonts for different columns, if those 
  fonts don't have the same line height the data will not line
  up properly. There is no workaround other than to use fonts
  with the same height.
