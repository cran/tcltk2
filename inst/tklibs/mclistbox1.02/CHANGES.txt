Changes to mclistbox.tcl and related files:

## version 1.02:

* fixed bugs in how yview was computed. yview should now return
  the proper value even when the window is resized, and scrolling
  the listbox after resizing should properly scroll all the way
  up and down.

* fixed some bugs when a column id has spaces in it

* fixed a bug in the label bind command, where curly braces were
  improperly being added around the %W substitution.

* added additional tests to the test suite, and improved the format
  of tests to be a bit more readable

* added the file "defs" to the distribution, so that the test
  script (mclistbox.test) would work. This is a modified version
  of the "defs" file that comes with the tcl source. The modifications
  allow for a more human-friendly format of the test data


## version 1.01:

* fixed bug where the fill column wasn't filling properly

* fixed bug when trying to canonize a column name.


## version 1.00 (final):

* fixed the -width option for columns; a width of zero should now 
  do what the documentation says it will do (e.g. set the column
  to be just wide enough to show the longest item)
 
* fixed the bug where we were trying to update the scrollbars even
  after the widget has been destroyed

* "column nearest" should now work

* a few other small bugs have been fixed



## version 1.00b3:

* =INCOMPATIBILITY= added the column option "-visible"; removed 
  the column commands "show" and "hide". This seems to be more
  "standard", and allows a way for the application programmer
  to query whether a column is visible or not.

* added the following widget commands: 'bbox', 'column nearest',
  'column cget'

* options and commands may now be specified with the shortest
  unique string (eg: -labela will be translated to -labelanchor,
  but -label will return an error since it matches several 
  options)

* documented the -font, -foreground and -background column
  options (oops!)

* column identifiers with embedded whitespace seem to work now.

* scanning in the x direction works now

* added support for -exportselection (hope I got it right!)

* resizable columns may be turned off on the widget as a 
  whole, and by column name (ie: you can mix and match
  columns which are resizable and those which aren't)

* example shows how to provide column-specific popup menus
  (press the right mouse button to see)

* fixed case where new columns weren't properly inheiriting
  the background color of the widget.

* update the documentation for the 'get' and 'column names' 
  commands to reflect the fact that 'column names' reports
  the order in which data is returned by 'get'.

* the fillcolumn now will not shrink below it's original size.
  If the user resizes the column interactively, the new
  size will become the new minimum size for filling.

* pkg_mkIndex should now properly index mclistbox.tcl without
  any extra effort

* lots of internal comments, and a slightly better conformance
  to the scriptics tcl style guide (though I'm still not perfect)

* the beginnings of a complete automated test suite based on the
  same code used by the tcl distribution

* other random bug fixes


### version 1.00b2:

* added -fillcolumn option. With this you can designate a column
  that will grow or shrink so that the widget is completely filled

* the command "label bind" has been added

* scanning in the Y direction has been fixed. The x direction is
  still busted.

* added the option -resizablecolumns; if set the columns can be
  resized interactively with the mouse.

* removed the option -labelimage. It was in by accident and 
  never had any effect.

* added -image and -bitmap options to "column configure"

* the example shows how to bind ButtonPress-1 to a label in order
  to sort the column.

* various bug fixes


### version 1.00b1:

* first public release
